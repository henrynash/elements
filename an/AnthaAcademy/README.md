# Antha Academy - A Directory of Tutorials to help you learn Antha

This directory contains lessons meant to teach the user the basics of the Antha Environment. 
It holds both workflows and elements.

## Pre-requisites


### Knowledge of programming terminology
Checkout the [free online dictionary](https://foldoc.org/) of computing as a great reference for computer programming termininology.

### Familiarity with the command line
You will need to use the command line to run antha.
If using OS X or Linux and you’re not familiar with working on the command line, this tour offers a good introduction for navigating through the command line in unix/linux:

1. Complete [Code academy working on the command line course Unit 1](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (2 hours) 

### Installation
If running Antha purely through the AnthaOS you don't need to install anything. If you want to run locally, please install following the instructions [here](../README.md).


### Basics of golang
2. Antha is a domain specific progrmaming language for biology built atop the [go](golang.org) programming language. Many of the core concepts in go also apply in Antha so if you're not familiar with the concepts of programming we highly recommend checking out chapters 1 to 9 of the [golang book](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/1).

#### For lesson 1 you will need to go through the material in chapters 1-4:

a. Getting started  

b. Reading a go program 

c. Types 

d. Variables 


#### For lesson 2 and 3 you will need to go through the material in chapters 5-9:

e. For/If/Switch 

f. Arrays/slices/maps 

g. Functions 

h. Pointers

i. Structs/interfaces/methods 



### Git and software project management
Git is a useful tool for collaborative software development projects and offers a great way to deal with managing code merges and version control.
Since antha is still in rapid development and we’re making changes on a weekly basis, you’ll need to use git for keeping up-to-date.

3. [Code academy Git course unit 1](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) (2 hours)
